# LYT Mode

LYT Mode is for "Linking Your Thinking".  
It invokes sensemaking and lateral thinking.  
This is where I do my sensemaking: in LYT Mode.  
LYT actually stands for: "Linking Your Thinking" Mode.  
It's meant to encourage sensemaking and lateral thinking.  
For me, I do both my creative and analytical work in LYT Mode.  

Enjoy!

## Why Use LYT Mode?
When a theme puts extra emphasis on making its formatting elements distinct (like bold and italics), it has a better chance at improving sensemaking.

This is because the more visually striking an image is, the more the user has to latch onto. Thinking and learning shift from being so abstract (words only). Instead, they more deeply engage the senses. 

> Each visually distinct word or phrase acts as another piece of an ever-evolving scaffolding from which we simultaneous shape and extract meaning. 

And that is why my favorite theme is LYT Mode (the evolution of Cybertron).
